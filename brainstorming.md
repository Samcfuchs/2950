# Phase 1: Brainstorming

## Dataset Ideas

Note: we can find a dataset on <http://Kaggle.com> but I think that if we can find a
more challenging data retrieval/processing task we will probably get more
credit. Would be neat if we can find an ultimate-related data set!

### Idea 1: AUDL Data

All-time player data: <https://theaudl.com/stats/players-all-time>
All-time team data: <https://theaudl.com/stats/team>

Has stats for a few hundred players that shouldn't be too hard to scrape. AUDL
also has per-season team stats. We could try to use player performance data to
predict team-level outcomes. Would be a fair amount of web-scraping. Another
challenge is associating the players with their teams by year. Each team has a
roster listed, but it's not listed by year and it might be difficult to parse.

### Idea 2: Videogame Playtime during the Quarantine

https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/
Gives data from when steam was first made, can be filtered in order to only start at a certain data

Additionally shows games with certain player counts so can do data on games based on price

Can look at games that were just released to see how many players they have
