## Dataset Ideas

Note: we can find a dataset on <http://Kaggle.com> but I think that if we can find a
more challenging data retrieval/processing task we will probably get more
credit. Would be neat if we can find an ultimate-related data set!

### Idea 1: AUDL Data

All-time player data: <https://theaudl.com/stats/players-all-time>
All-time team data: <https://theaudl.com/stats/team>

Has stats for a few hundred players that shouldn't be too hard to scrape. AUDL
also has per-season team stats. We could try to use player performance data to
predict team-level outcomes. Would be a fair amount of web-scraping. Another
challenge is associating the players with their teams by year. Each team has a
roster listed, but it's not listed by year and it might be difficult to parse.
