# Phase 1: Brainstorming

## Dataset Ideas

Note: we can find a dataset on <http://Kaggle.com> but I think that if we can
find a more challenging data retrieval/processing task we will probably get more
credit and build a better project. Would be neat if we can find an
ultimate-related data set!

### Idea 1: AUDL Data

- All-time player data: <https://theaudl.com/stats/players-all-time>
- All-time team data: <https://theaudl.com/stats/team>

Has stats for a few hundred players that shouldn't be too hard to scrape. AUDL
also has per-season team stats. We could try to use player performance data to
predict team-level outcomes. Would be a fair amount of web-scraping. Another
challenge is associating the players with their teams by year. Each team has a
roster listed, but it's not listed by year and it might be difficult to parse.

### Idea 2: Reddit

Reddit has a *very* comprehensive API that makes it relatively easy to extract
big datasets. We could build a dataset from that API without too much trouble
and predict, for example, how many upvotes a post gets or something...maybe we
could find a domain-appropriate complement dataset to cross-compare.

### Idea 3: Videogame playtime during the Quarantine

<https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/>

Gives data from when steam was first made, can be filtered in order to only
start at a certain data

Additionally shows games with certain player counts so can do data on games
based on price

Can look at games that were just released to see how many players they have

(<https://steamcharts.com/top>)

<https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetGlobalAchievementPercentagesForApp_.28v0001.29> = how to get game data?

<https://steamcommunity.com/dev>

Want to compare new games, and prices of games and how their playerbase has changed over time

### Idea 4

- <https://play.usaultimate.org/teams/events/team_rankings/?RankSet=College-Men>
- <https://play.usaultimate.org/events/2019-US-Open-Club-Championship/>

Would need to navigate into each division for YCC along with multiple years.

### Idea 5
